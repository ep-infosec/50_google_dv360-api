This repository contains code examples for the [DV360 API](https://developers.google.com/display-video/api/reference/rest). Especially:

* [Weather Based Marketing Spreadsheet](/spreadsheet-weather-based-marketing)
* [Apps Script Weather Based Marketing](/appsscript-weather-based-marketing)

## What is the difference between [Weather Based Marketing Spreadsheet](/spreadsheet-weather-based-marketing) and [Apps Script Weather Based Marketing](/appsscript-weather-based-marketing)?

- The main difference is that for using the [Spreadsheet Weather Based Marketing](/spreadsheet-weather-based-marketing) you need much less JavaScript knowledge (after the installation everything you need is spreadsheet working skills). On the other hand if you need more simple code example and you have JavaScript knowledge you can look at the [Apps Script Weather Based Marketing](/appsscript-weather-based-marketing) solution.
- Also Weather Based Marketing Spreadsheet supports almost any API (Apps Script Weather Based Marketing works only with OpenWeatherMap API).
- Weather Based Marketing Spreadsheet supports DV360, Google Ads, SA360 (Apps Script Weather Based Marketing works only with DV360).
